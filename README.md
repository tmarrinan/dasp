# Depth Augmented Stereo Panorama (DASP) WebXR Viewer

A virtual reality viewing application for DASP images (as described in [[1](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2016.7552858)]). We have made a few minor tweaks to that technique:

* DASP images should be rendered using an infinite convergence distance (i.e. parallel spherical projection)
* No shrinking viewing radius with elevation angle (i.e. no pole merging)
